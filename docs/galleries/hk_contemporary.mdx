The quaint town of Cullinan, celebrated for its diamond mining heritage and unique corrugated iron architecture, is set to unveil an exciting new cultural destination.

Opened on March 28 2024, the HK Contemporary Art Museum, Gallery, and Studio made its debut. Situated in an eye-catching cob house created by the late artist Marcella De Boom, this space serves as an exquisite setting to showcase a vast collection of art.
