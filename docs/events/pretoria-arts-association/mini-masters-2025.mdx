# Mini Masters 2025

## Event Description

An intimate showcase called Mini Masters at the Association of Arts Pretoria will be opened by Kevin Collins, Chairperson of Ceramics Southern Africa, on Saturday 1 November 2025 at 11:00.  It will be open to the public until 22 November.

It will display the power of scale, presenting the work of great masters in miniature:  refined, original artworks crafted in small format.  Each of the artists has been invited to exhibit three small-scale pieces, representing a wide variety of artistic mediums and styles.  Though modest in scale, these works carry a powerful presence, distilling vision and artistry into concentrated form.
 
For collectors and art enthusiasts it is a rare opportunity to encounter and acquire exceptional artworks in an accessible and highly collectible form.  Inviting one to look closer, the Mini Masters exhibition proves that great art transcends size.  In total 42 artists are participating, promising an exciting and varied collection.
