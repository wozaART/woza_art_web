# 13th epicARTS Christmas Exhibition '25 with Almero

## Event Description

It's an honour to invite you to our 13th epicARTS Christmas Exhibition '25! The success of our exhibitions is something I could not have dreamed about, but how thankful am I for all your support and how lucky am I to showcase my work alongside 20 super talented Gauteng-based artists!
All art on display will be for sale directly from the artists making it extremely affordable. There will be a Coffee corner to keep our hands and hearts warm. Come and enjoy this weekend of art with friends and loved ones for our 13th epicARTS Christmas Exhibition like no other for that special gift or just to spoil yourself!

The exhibition will officially open on Saturday, 6 December 2025, with live music from the amazing Almero (singer and writer of the soundtrack of kykNET's 'Eenkeer om die son') and this will happen in a picnic style (so bring a chair or a blanket and pack a delicious picnic basket to enjoy the evening with friends and family) AND you will also have the opportunity to view the exhibition before it opens to the general public on Wednesday, December 10th and it will be open until Tuesday, December 16th.

December 6th entrance is R180* per person (included live music) while entrance is FREE from December 10th- December 16th (although you do not want to miss the opening)!

Although we do have official gallery hours, a viewing can be arranged outside these hours by booking- Whatsapp 0824517709
Dian Louw from epicARTS as well as the first winner of the kykNET reality show 'Plaasjapie' will act as the curator for this not-to-be-missed event!

We cannot wait to welcome you and your loved ones!

*Children under 7 years free entry
