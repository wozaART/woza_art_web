### About Multi Vision

Ryan Loubser is a South African artist whose primary focus is oil painting. He fragments his surfaces to create optical illusions within his works. Often ending with more than one visual per artwork. Standing directly in front of one of his paintings the viewer is often unsure. Forcing them to try make sense of their reality. Only apon moving around the artwork does one gain a sense of what the artwork is about.
