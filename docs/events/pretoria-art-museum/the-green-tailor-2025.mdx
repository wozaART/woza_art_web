### Why the Pretoria Art Museum?

Well first we ask the question. What is the sculpture on this poster?

:::info
So how did a Olmec Head get to South Africa? And why are the features of this Mexican sculpture so African?
:::

The 2.2 meter tall Basaltic statue was a gift from <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Alemán_Valdés">Miguel Alemán Valdés</Link> a Mexican politician who served a full term as the President of Mexico from 1946 to 1952.

<Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Alemán_Velasco">Velasco</Link> donated the two-metre-high statue to the city to mark 10 years of democracy in South Africa. The statue is a replica of 17 original sculptures found in the eastern jungles of Mexico by archaeologists in 1862. They were at first thought to be relics of the Mayan civilisation, but the mystery was solved in 1942 when it became apparent they belonged to the Olmecs.

How and why, with no known contact between South America and Africa 3000 years ago, were such colossal sculptures which are clearly African created?

#### The Pelmama Permanent Art Collection

The Pelmama Collection which is in rotation annually features work by artists such as Judith Mason. Which was on display this year at the museum.

Including an artwork which shocked me to my inner being. You simply can not replace viewing the raw intensity of an artwork with an online image. 
Earlier this year I came into contact with this artwork by Judith Mason.

**Artist:** Judith Mason, 1938 - 2016<br/>
**Title:** The body on a beach in a dark night, 1966<br/>
**Medium:** Oil on board<br/>

**Description:**<br/>
This abandoned, disintegrating figure surrounded by night-lit seascape elements reflects the
pessimism I felt as a young political activist in the early '60's. South Africa was becoming increasingly
polarised, the Hungarian Revolution was recent history, and people were becoming more aware of the
ravages of Nazism and Stalinism. I was very affected by the writings of Nadesha and Osip Mandelstam
and the latter's question: "Whose blood will mend the broken back of two long centuries?" The body
here is a broken carcass, suggesting the animal inevitability of a life without transcendent grace, with
personal history as detritus.

## About the Pretoria Art Museum

The Pretoria Art Museum came into being to house the Municipality’s growing art collection, which had been built up since the early 1930s. The Pretoria Art Museum was officially opened in 1964. As other South African art museums had already assembled examples of European art, it was decided to concentrate on establishing a representative collection of South African art. The Pretoria Art Museum has since been giving more attention to contemporary developments in Southern African art. The Pretoria Art Museums’ vision is to establish and conserve a representative, high-quality permanent collection of South African art, past and present, reflecting all genres, art mediums, art movements, influences and leading figures, supplemented by traditional South African craftwork.
