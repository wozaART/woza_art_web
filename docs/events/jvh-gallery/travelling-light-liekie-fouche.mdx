# Travelling Light

## Event Description

The art exhibition Travelling Light by Liekie Fouché presents a poetic and dream-laden journey through landscapes of the psyche, nature and the subtle interplay of light and weightlessness. Though specific promotional details about this precise showing are scarce, the work of the artist, and the visual cues in the pieces, give us rich material to describe the exhibition’s character and themes.

In Travelling Light, Fouché invites the viewer to embark upon a journey that is both literal and metaphorical — to move lightly, across imagined skies, drifting landscapes, suspended time and weightless beings. A rabbit-figure in a robe looks skyward; an airship hovers above a green hill and dark horizon; the skies bend toward you in pastel and gold. The title evokes dual meanings: the notion of travel or movement, and the letting go of burdens—of heaviness, of gravity, of the literal weight that grounds us.

She draws from her North-West South African childhood on a farm, landscapes of isolation, open skies, and the vastness of nature — then transforms these into meditative dreamscapes. <Link href="https://www.artlovers1932.co.za/Liekie_Fouche.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Art Lovers 1932</Link>

In Travelling Light, we see this technique applied to a sense of motion, of flight, of lightness. The combination of collage and drawing, the layering of varnish, the delicate use of pastel and graphite—these all create works that appear still yet dynamical; anchored yet aerial.
