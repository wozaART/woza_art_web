# Smoky Hounds and Inky Chicks

## Event Description

The title **“Smoky Hounds and Inky Chicks”** offers a playful yet textured entry into Clark’s exploration of form and process. The “smoky” and “inky” reference materials and techniques that underpin the body of work — smoke, soot, charcoal, ink — while “hounds” and “chicks” evoke whimsical, semi-figurative creatures. 

**In her own words:** “These texture experiments with smoke, soot, ink and other substances are used to create playful beasties loosely inspired by the hounds and chicks of the Tankwa Karoo I visited earlier this year.” 

In this exhibition, Clark uses these unconventional materials to test surface, mark-making, and the unexpected emergence of forms — creatures that seem to exist in the in-between: half-seen, half-made, gestural, and maybe mischievous.

### Why this Exhibition Matters

* The exhibition provides a space for viewers to engage with the physicality of materials (smoke, soot, ink) in a fine-art context.
* It invites reflection on how urban traces become visual metaphor: what is residue, what becomes life, what becomes form?
* For the Pretoria art scene and beyond, it adds to Clark’s ongoing exploration of new formats, new subject-matter, and expands her practice into more imaginative, speculative terrain.
