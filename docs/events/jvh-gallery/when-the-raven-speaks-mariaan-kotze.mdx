# When the Raven Speaks

## Event Description

`When the Raven Speaks` is an intimate, informal showcase of my newest body of work — a mysterious gathering of black birds.
Although the theme centres around the Raven, you’ll find a whole flock of black birds — Ravens, Crows, and their kin from the Corvidae family — emerging through paint, texture, and symbolism.
