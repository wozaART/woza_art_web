# Scapes

## Event Description

Curatorial Brief to the artists by Sammy Muller

Did you know that there are more than 60 words that include "scapes"? Some are familiar, like landscapes, seascapes, and cloudspaces. Others are less common but just as inspiring, one of my favourites is bathyscapes.

For this exhibition, we invited the artists to explore any word that contains "scapes" ; it can appear in the beginning, middle, or end of the word. 
This exhibition explores the traditional idea of "scapes" in art, from landscape and seascapes to a more modern interpretation of "scapes". Artists were asked to research and use any word containing scape in them, as inspiration or to create a new and imagined scape.

The Viewing Room Art Gallery, established in Pretoria in 2007, is a contemporary space dedicated to showcasing both emerging and established artists. The gallery offers a unique experience by blending art with architecture. Visitors are immersed in an exceptional architectural environment, where the design of the space itself complements and elevates the art on display. With a double-story layout, the gallery regularly hosts multiple exhibitions, creating a dynamic and ever-evolving cultural experience unlike any other. Under the direction of Lucy Anastasiadis, the gallery also draws from her extensive background in fashion, providing a creative, multidisciplinary approach to curating. Lucy analyzes each work of art with the same attention to detail and vision she once applied to fashion, making the exhibitions visually compelling and intellectually engaging. Though St. Lorient's fashion chapter has closed, Lucy remains dedicated to promoting the arts. The Viewing Room continues to offer a platform for both national and international artists, ensuring that visitors experience a fusion of art, architecture, and innovation in every exhibition.
