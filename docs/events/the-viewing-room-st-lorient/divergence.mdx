# Divergence

## Event Description

**Curated by** Mohaladitwe Halle Gumede

Divergence brings together the different voices of third-year art students, each exploring their own path through glass, ceramics, sculpture, drawing, painting etc. While the works differ in medium, style, and approach, they come together in their shared commitment for experimentation and reflection and the title speaks to the individuality of each artist’s vision.

In this exhibition, divergence becomes a strength, a celebration of difference, of material exploration, and of the many directions creative journeys can take. Together, these works embody the curiosity and energy of a generation of emerging artists, offering viewers a glimpse into practices that are as varied as they are interconnected.

Mohaladitwe Halle Gumede is a dynamic South African curator and cultural practitioner whose work explores the intersections of identity, environment, and evolving artistic expression in contemporary Africa. With a curatorial approach rooted in dialogue and experimentation, Gumede foregrounds artists who challenge convention and embrace hybridity—those who use visual language as a means to question, reclaim, and reimagine. His practice is guided by a sensitivity to both material and narrative, drawing connections between personal histories and collective transformation.

The Viewing Room Art Gallery, established in Pretoria in 2007, is a contemporary space dedicated to showcasing both emerging and established artists. The gallery offers a unique experience by blending art with architecture. Visitors are immersed in an exceptional architectural environment, where the design of the space itself complements and elevates the art on display. With a double-story layout, the gallery regularly hosts multiple exhibitions, creating a dynamic and ever-evolving cultural experience unlike any other. Under the direction of Lucy Anastasiadis, the gallery also draws from her extensive background in fashion, providing a creative, multidisciplinary approach to curating. Lucy analyzes each work of art with the same attention to detail and vision she once applied to fashion, making the exhibitions visually compelling and intellectually engaging. Though St. Lorient's fashion chapter has closed, Lucy remains dedicated to promoting the arts. The Viewing Room continues to offer a platform for both national and international artists, ensuring that visitors experience a fusion of art, architecture, and innovation in every exhibition.
