## About The Showroom Art Gallery

The Showroom Art Gallery is a vibrant celebration of creativity, passion, and fine art. Founded and curated by Ilze du Preez, the gallery is the culmination of her lifelong dedication to connecting people with beautiful, meaningful artwork.

Ilze’s journey began at just nineteen, when she sold eight paintings at her very first exhibition—a clear sign of her natural talent and entrepreneurial spirit. Over the years, she has collaborated with numerous talented artists and established art galleries, combining experience and passion into what has become a thriving artistic enterprise.

Rooted in both art and family, The Showroom Art Gallery reflects Ilze’s belief that art should be accessible and enriching for everyone—from first-time buyers to seasoned collectors and corporate clients. Her early venture into custom framing laid the foundation for the gallery’s enduring commitment to quality presentation, a partnership that continues today to ensure each piece is displayed at its finest.

Today, The Showroom Art Gallery stands as a trusted destination for art lovers seeking exceptional pieces and expert guidance. Whether you’re investing in art or discovering something new for your home or business, The Showroom Art Gallery is dedicated to helping you find the perfect work of art—beautifully framed, thoughtfully curated, and deeply inspiring.
