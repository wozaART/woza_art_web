USM’s iconic modular furniture represents a perfect harmony between precision and imagination. Its timeless design and the palette of fourteen distinct colours create a foundation for dialogue between art and architecture, structure and emotion.

This curated presentation brings together artists from Candice Berman Gallery whose practices echo USM’s enduring values of balance, clarity, and creativity. Each artist responds to colour as a language of expression, allowing tone, surface, and rhythm to converse with the modular beauty of the furniture itself.

Together, the collection becomes more than an exhibition of design and art. It is a conversation about the relationship between object and environment, between order and play. Through this collaboration, USM’s mastery of form meets the gallery’s celebration of artistic expression, creating a unified vision where colour becomes experience.
