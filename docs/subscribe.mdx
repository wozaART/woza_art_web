## Subscription FAQ's

### What is a subscription channel?

We use [WhatsApp Channels](https://faq.whatsapp.com/549900560675125/?helpref=hc_fnav) which is a one-way broadcast feature for organizations and individuals to send updates to followers, located in the "Updates" tab of the app, separate from personal chats. Followers can't reply or message the admin, but they can react to posts with emojis or vote on polls. Updates can include text, photos, videos, links, audio, and stickers. 

**How WhatsApp Channels work**

* **One-way broadcast**: Admins can post updates that followers can see and react to, but followers cannot reply directly to the channel or message the admin.
* **Discovery and updates**: Channels are found in the "Updates" tab, alongside Status updates. You can discover new channels through an invite link, a searchable directory, or by seeing popular channels in your region.
* **Content types**: Updates can be text, images, videos, stickers, links, audio, or polls.
* **Admin and follower privacy**: When following a channel, your phone number is not shared with the channel admin or other followers. Channel admins also have their personal contact details hidden from followers.
* **Reactions and polls**: Followers can react to updates with emojis or participate in polls to show interest.
* **Forwarding**: When a follower forwards a channel update, it includes a link back to the original channel.

### How to subscribe

By tapping on one of the links above. You can subscribe to art events within your region. The event updates will come directly to your `Updates` section in WhatsApp.

You can also follow channels from their channel info page. When you follow a channel, you'll see updates like written notes, links to information, or media (such as photos, or videos) from them on the Channels page. To know when there's a new channel update, you can also choose to turn on notifications for a channel.

### How to manage channel notifications

When you follow a channel, notifications are muted by default. To get alerts about new updates, you can choose to turn on notifications for a channel. When turned on, notifications will work the same as they do for your WhatsApp personal messages. Learn how to customize things like notification sounds, vibrations and more.

### Can I unsubscribe in future

You can unfollow a channel at any time. When you unfollow, you won’t get update notifications or see the channel in your Updates tab.

**Note:** You can't search for channels that you've unfollowed or deleted.
